- Many users report feeling overwhelmed by the vast feature set
- **Quote from user**: "Notion is definitely overkill for simple note-taking or task management"

### 2. **Performance & Speed Issues**
- Persistent bugs and app instability (typing cuts out, text randomly restarts)
- Tasks marked as completed inexplicably revert to unfinished state
- Slow loading times, especially with:
  - Large databases
  - Multiple linked databases
  - Complex formulas and rollups
  - High-resolution images and media
- Mobile app historically slower with limited functionality

### 3. **Feature Limitations**
- Described as "jack of all trades" that doesn't excel in any one area
- Tables/spreadsheets can't perform advanced calculations like Excel
- Project management capabilities can't match specialized tools (Jira, Asana)
- Missing basic features:
  - True calendar view (historically)
  - Limited formatting and export options
  - No bulk PDF export on personal plans
  - No true offline mode
  - Lack of end-to-end encryption

### 4. **The "Middle Ground" Problem**
- Too complex for simple needs

## Performance Issues

### 1. **Database-Related Slowdowns**
- Number of pages in database directly impacts speed
- More visible properties = longer load times
- Complex sorts/filters on formulas, rollups, text properties cause delays
- Multiple databases on high-traffic pages stress the system

### 2. **Technical Factors**
- High bandwidth requirements for optimal performance
- Memory-intensive features (projects, advanced databases)
- Third-party integrations slow down pages
- Large media files (especially Unsplash images) impact loading
- Nested documents create search complexity

### 3. **Optimization Challenges**
- Users forced to compromise between functionality and performance
- Complex reference chains between formulas and rollups
- Linked databases in columns particularly problematic
- Cache buildup requires regular clearing

## Mobile App Limitations

### 1. **Functional Restrictions**
Cannot perform these actions on mobile:
- Select multiple blocks simultaneously
- Import data
- Change account information
- Delete or leave workspaces
- Edit workspace security settings
- Edit plan or billing settings

- No column support (collapsed to single column)
- Different navigation paradigm
- Reduced formatting options

### 3. **Performance Issues**
- Slower startup times
- Less intuitive UI compared to desktop
- Syncing delays
- Limited offline functionality

## Collaboration Pain Points

### 1. **Team Scaling Issues**
- Notion becomes too complex as teams grow
- Only power users can master advanced features
- Creates silos where only tech-savvy teams leverage full potential
- Difficulty maintaining consistent usage patterns across departments

### 2. **Real-time Collaboration**
